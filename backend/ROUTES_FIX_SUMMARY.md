# Backend Routes Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Location Routes Fixed**
- **Problem**: Routes were defined as `/:id/locations` but mounted at `/api/locations`, resulting in confusing URLs like `/api/locations/123/locations`
- **Solution**: Changed routes to `/user/:id` so the final URLs are clean: `/api/locations/user/123`

### 2. **Issue Routes Order Fixed**
- **Problem**: Dynamic routes like `/:id` were placed before static routes like `/map/pins` and `/nearby`, causing route conflicts
- **Solution**: Moved static routes (`/map/pins`, `/nearby`) before dynamic routes (`/:id`)

### 3. **Environment Variables & Configuration**
- **Problem**: Missing `.env` file and JWT_SECRET validation
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `.env` file with required variables
  - Added validation in `config/env.js` to check for required environment variables
  - Updated all JWT usage to import from centralized config

### 4. **Database Connection & Setup**
- **Problem**: No database setup or connection validation
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `database_setup.sql` with complete database schema
  - Added `setup-database.js` script for easy database initialization
  - Added database connection testing to health endpoint

### 5. **Better Error Handling & Route Information**
- **Problem**: Generic error messages and no route discovery
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced root endpoint to show available API routes
  - Added `/health` endpoint for monitoring database connectivity
  - Improved 404 handler to show available routes
  - Better error messages throughout the application

## Current Working Routes

### ✅ **Working Routes** (with proper authentication/validation)
```
GET  /                           - API info and available endpoints
GET  /health                     - Health check with database status
GET  /api/issues/nearby?lat&lng  - Get nearby issues (requires coordinates)
GET  /api/locations/user/:id     - Get user locations (requires auth)
POST /api/locations/user/:id     - Add user location (requires auth)
GET  /api/issues/map/pins        - Get issue map pins
```

### ⚠️ **Routes with Database Dependency** (will work once database is connected)
```
GET  /api/issues                 - Get all issues
GET  /api/issues/:id             - Get issue by ID
POST /api/issues                 - Create new issue
GET  /api/admin/categories       - Get categories
POST /api/users/register         - User registration
POST /api/users/login            - User login
```

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Run `npm run setup-db` to initialize the database
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
3. **Test Authentication**: Register a user and test authenticated routes
4. **Test Admin Routes**: Create admin user and test admin functionality

## Database Setup Command
```bash
npm run setup-db
```

## Environment Variables Required
```
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/odoo_hackthem
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Route Structure Summary
```
/api/users/*         - User authentication and profile
/api/issues/*        - Issue management and reporting
/api/admin/*         - Admin panel functionality
/api/locations/*     - User location management
/api/notifications/* - User notifications
```

All routes now have proper error handling, authentication checks, and consistent response formats.
