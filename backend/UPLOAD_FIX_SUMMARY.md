# Upload Error Handling Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing "Unhandled Error" when file uploads failed validation in the `fileFilter` function of the upload middleware. The error was being thrown but not properly caught by Express's error handling middleware.

## Root Cause
Multer's `fileFilter` errors need special handling. When an error is passed to the callback in `fileFilter`, it can cause unhandled promise rejections if not properly wrapped.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced File Filter Error Handling
- Modified `fileFilter` to set a status code on the error object
- Added debug logging to track file validation process

### 2. Created Multer Error Wrapper
- Implemented `handleMulterErrors` function to properly catch and handle all multer-related errors
- Added specific error handling for:
  - `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE` - File too large
  - `LIMIT_FILE_COUNT` - Too many files
  - `LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE` - Wrong field name
  - Custom file filter errors

### 3. Updated Export Structure
- Changed from exporting the raw multer instance to exporting wrapped functions
- Maintained the same API (single, array, fields, none) but with proper error handling

## Files Modified
- `/backend/middlewares/upload.js` - Enhanced error handling and logging
- Created `/backend/test-upload.js` - Test script for validation

## Testing
The fix should now properly return HTTP 400 errors with appropriate error messages instead of causing unhandled errors when:
- Invalid file types are uploaded
- File size limits are exceeded
- Too many files are uploaded
- Wrong field names are used

## Expected Behavior
When an invalid file is uploaded, the client will receive:
```json
{
  "error": "Only image files (jpeg, jpg, png, webp) are allowed"
}
```
Instead of an unhandled server error.
